# Software Development Models

## Waterfall Model
The Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It consists of distinct phases such as requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins, and there is little room for changes once a phase is completed.

## V-Model
The V-Model, also known as the Verification and Validation model, is an extension of the Waterfall Model. It emphasizes the importance of validation and verification at each stage of development. The model is shaped like a "V" where each development phase on the left side has a corresponding testing phase on the right side. This ensures that each phase is thoroughly tested before moving on to the next.

## Spiral Model
The Spiral Model combines iterative development with systematic aspects of the Waterfall Model. It allows for incremental releases of the product, or incremental refinement through each iteration around the spiral. Each cycle involves planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. This model is particularly useful for large, complex, and high-risk projects.
